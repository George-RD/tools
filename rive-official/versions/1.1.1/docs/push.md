# Pushing a project to a Rive file

`rive push` builds the project and sends the result straight to a Rive file in
your workspace — no `.rev` on disk, no drag and drop. The file opens from the
editor's file browser like any other, and every push lands as a named entry in
its revision history, so any push can be inspected or restored from the
editor's revision panel.

```bash
rive login              # once per machine: same session as --publish
rive push               # build and push; the first push creates the file
```

## Starting from a file that already exists

Work that is already in Rive does not have to start over as a new project:

```bash
rive create --from-remote-file          # pick a project, then a file
rive create hero --from-remote-file=512 # or name both
```

This downloads the file and converts it the way `--from-rev` converts a `.rev`
off disk: `scene.rml`, with every script and asset as a file laid out as the
Assets panel. The directory has to be empty or new; without one, the remote
file's name is used.

The command first tries to download the file's live content from the change log, matching
the state the editor shows. If the change log is unavailable, it receives the same live
content from the sync server, the way `rive push` does. If that fails too, it falls back to
the newest saved revision. Binary assets — images, fonts, audio — are fetched from the asset store, 
since the editor keeps their bytes outside the document itself.

The link to the file is recorded in `rive.yaml` exactly as a first push would
record it, so `rive push <dir>` sends your edits back to it, and
`rive pull <dir>` brings later editor changes down. `--from-remote-file` itself
always writes a new directory; use `pull` to refresh one that exists.

Because what you get back is meant for a push, the picker lists the projects
`rive push` lists — the ones you can write to. Naming a file id skips the
picker and pulls any file you can open, view-only projects included.

## Pulling it back down

`rive pull` is the inverse: it downloads the file the project is linked to and writes it over
the project.

A project gets that link two ways. The first `rive push` creates the file and links it, and
`rive create --from-remote-file` links the file it started from. Either way `rive pull` works
from then on, and a project with no `push:` block is told to use one of the two.

```bash
rive pull            # asks before overwriting
rive pull --yes      # skip the prompt (required in CI, and with no terminal)
```

`--quiet` drops the download line and the "already matched" count, leaving only
what changed.

It rewrites the scene markup and every script, shader and asset the remote file holds, and
reports what changed:

```
downloaded 12084 bytes from changelog at 157, 3 assets
pulled file 512 into demo
  scene.rml           updated
  ui/button.luau      updated
  images/logo.png     added
  (4 files already matched)
```

What the remote holds wins — local edits to those files are lost, which is why it asks first.
`rive.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and anything you added yourself are left alone, and a
file whose bytes already match is not rewritten at all, so an unchanged pull will not wake the
watcher.

Files that are in the project but *not* in the remote file are listed rather than deleted:
nothing can tell an asset the editor dropped from one you added on purpose. Keep the project in
source control and the whole overwrite is reviewable as a diff.

## The first push

A file lives in a project, so the first push has to pick one. Every
workspace's personal files count as a project here, listed first as
`<workspace> / Personal Files`, so a push can land in your own drafts as
easily as in a shared project. Projects you can only view are left out.

- with a single project in your account, it is picked automatically
- with several, the CLI opens a picker: up and down (or Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N)
  move, typing narrows the list -- each word has to appear somewhere, so
  `acme spin` finds "acme / Spinner" -- enter chooses, and escape backs out
- where no picker can draw but somebody is still typing -- Windows,
  `TERM=dumb`, `RIVE_NO_TUI=1`, or a terminal that refuses raw mode -- it
  falls back to the numbered list and prompts for a number
- with stdin not a terminal, as in CI, it lists the projects and exits, so
  scripted runs stay deterministic. Redirecting stdout alone is not enough:
  the picker draws on stderr, so `rive push > log` still asks
- `--project=<id>` skips the picker (`rive push --list` prints every project
  with its id, without building anything)

The link to the created file is recorded in `rive.yaml`:

```yaml
push:
  projectId: 9
  fileId: 512
```

Commit this so everyone pushing the project updates the same file. Delete the
`fileId` line (or the whole block) to make the next push create a fresh file;
edit `projectId` to create it somewhere else.

## Every push after

A later push diffs the new build against the file's live content and sends
only what differs, then names a revision. `--name` labels it — useful when a
push marks something:

```bash
rive push --name="before the terrain rewrite"
```

A push with nothing new reports `already up to date` and adds no revision.
The previous content is never lost: it stays in the revision history, and the
editor can restore any entry. If someone has the file open in the editor while
you push, they see the content swap live, like a collaborator's edit — and
any editor-made changes to pushed content are overwritten, the push is
authoritative.

## Ids stay stable

Logically-same things keep their coop object ids across pushes: an asset by
its module path, an artboard (and its layout graph) by its name, folders by
their path. That matters when the pushed file is used as a library — a
consumer's reference to a library component points at an object id in this
file, and renaming *other* assets or adding new ones does not move it. Ids do
change when the thing itself is renamed or moved (it reads as a new object),
and the internal code line/run tree is renumbered whenever a source file's
text changes.

## Sessions

Push uses the same `rive login` token as `--publish` and watermark, and so do
`rive create --from-remote-file` and `rive pull`. After the API started issuing
`cli:write` on new logins, anyone who signed in before that must run
`rive login` again — refresh does not upgrade an old token.

A 401 on `/api/me` or on opening the linked file is a stale login.

## What is pushed

Exactly what `--rev` would export: the project's own scripts, assets and
artboards, minus everything `excludeFromRev` drops. Libraries are not pushed —
each library exports its own `.rev` and is published separately.

## When something goes wrong

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Not logged in` | never signed in here; run `rive login` |
| `stale login` | token is old or rejected; run `rive login` again |
| `file <id> is missing or not accessible` | the linked file was deleted or you lost access; clear `push.fileId` to create a new one |
| `not authorized for this file` | stale login or no edit permission; try `rive login` |
| `push aborted: build failed` | fix the build first; `rive <dir> --verify` shows the problems |
| `<dir> already contains files` | `--from-remote-file` writes a whole tree, so it wants an empty or new directory |
| `has never been saved` | the file has no content to download; open it in the editor once |
| `asset <id> download failed` | an asset the file references is not readable by your account |
| `rive.yaml has no link to a remote Rive file` | the project was never linked; push once, or start it with `rive create --from-remote-file` |
| `pull overwrites the project's ... rerun with --yes` | `rive pull` asks before overwriting and there is nobody to ask: CI, `RIVE_NO_TUI`, or no terminal |

A failed push never half-applies: content changes only land once the server
has accepted every change set, and the revision entry is added after that.
