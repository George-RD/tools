# Getting started

For a person setting the tool up for the first time. Everything after this page
is reference for authoring, most of it written for a coding agent to read.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://releases.rive.app/cli/install.sh | sh
```

The installer puts the binary in `~/.rive/bin` and prints an `export PATH=...`
line if that directory is not already on your `PATH`. Add it to your shell
profile, or the `rive` command will not be found in a new terminal.

Check it:

```bash
rive --version
rive doctor
```

`doctor` reports the version, whether you are signed in, whether the ports the
watcher needs are free, and whether the current directory is a project.

A curl install may print a one-line hint when a newer CLI is published (at most
once a day). If this build is below the required minimum it exits 8; run
`rive update`.

## Sign in

```bash
rive login
```

Opens a browser to authorise the CLI. You need this for `--publish`, which
signs through the API, for `--rev`, which exports the file a designer opens
in the editor, and for `rive push`. One login covers all three.

Every other project run is local and works signed out *and* offline: watching,
`--once`, `--verify`, `--test`, `--screenshot`, `--serve`.

The standalone commands — `create`, `docs`, `samples`, `schema`, `inspect`,
`doctor` and the rest — need no account either, but not all of them are
offline: `update` fetches release metadata, `whoami` and `doctor` call the
account service. `rive --help` has the full map.

## Make a project

A project is any directory with a `rive.yaml` in it. `rive create` writes one:

```bash
rive create myproject
```

That gives you five files:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `rive.yaml` | project config; only `name` is required |
| `scene.rml` | the scene — an empty artboard, timeline and state machine |
| `AGENTS.md` | instructions a coding agent reads when it opens the folder |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `@AGENTS.md`; Claude Code reads this name, not `AGENTS.md` |
| `.gitignore` | ignores `build/` |

Everything else in the directory is picked up by extension — `.luau` scripts,
`.wgsl` shaders, `.png`/`.jpg` images, fonts, and any other file as a blob.
There is no manifest to maintain. See
[project/rive-yaml.md](project/rive-yaml.md).

## Run it

```bash
rive myproject
```

Opens a window showing the scene and watches the directory. Save any file and
it rebuilds and reloads. The built file lands at `myproject/build/myproject.riv`
— that is the file you ship to a runtime.

A fresh project's scene has nothing drawn in it yet, so what you get is a dark
rectangle. That is the loop working. What it does have is the frame the editor
gives a new file — an artboard, a timeline named `Animation 1`, and a state
machine that plays it on load — so a shape you add and key starts animating
without any further wiring. [skeleton.md](skeleton.md) fills that same frame in
line by line, and `rive samples` has larger scenes.

Type `?` in the terminal while watching for the commands available there
(screenshot, pause, artboard, rev export).

One-shot alternatives, for scripts and CI:

```bash
rive myproject --verify     # compile only, no output, exit 1 on errors
rive myproject --once       # write an unsigned .riv
rive myproject --publish    # write a signed .riv (required for web)
```

Scripts destined for the web must be built with `--publish` — unsigned scripts
are rejected by the CDN and web runtimes. See [publishing.md](publishing.md).

## Then what — hand it to an agent

Authoring a scene means writing RML and Luau, and the CLI is built for a coding
agent to do that: `rive create` drops an `AGENTS.md` in the project telling the
agent how to look things up and how to check its work, and a `CLAUDE.md` that
imports it, since Claude Code only reads its own file name. Cursor, Codex and
Copilot read `AGENTS.md` directly.

So the intended loop is: create the project, open the folder in your coding
agent, and describe what you want. The agent reads `AGENTS.md`, uses
`rive docs` and `rive schema` to look up types, and runs `rive . --verify` and
`rive inspect . --json` to check what it built. Keep `rive myproject` running in
another terminal and you will watch it happen — or ask the agent to start it;
it knows to run the previewer in the background.

The window is the preview. `rive push` is not: it uploads to your Rive account.
Nor is a web page: local builds carry unsigned scripts, which web runtimes reject.

Authoring by hand works too — [skeleton.md](skeleton.md) is a complete file
annotated line by line, and [format.md](format.md) is the shortest path to
understanding RML.

## Start from something that works

```bash
rive samples
```

Opens a picker over the runnable example projects that ship with the CLI,
each a complete project on its own. Up and down move, typing narrows the
list, and enter asks where to copy the one you chose:

```
which sample?
> hello_rive    A script drawing a scene, with an image asset and a shader
  rml_triangle  The smallest RML document: one artboard, one shape
```

Then build it:

```bash
rive myproject
```

Where no picker can draw -- Windows, stdin or stderr not a terminal as in
CI, `TERM=dumb`, or `RIVE_NO_TUI=1` -- the same command lists the samples
instead and you copy one by hand. Redirecting stdout alone is not enough: the picker
draws on stderr, so `rive samples > log` still asks.

```bash
cp -R "$(rive samples --path)/rml_triangle" myproject
```

## Start from an existing Rive file

There are two starting points, and what separates them is whether the project
ends up linked to a file in your workspace.

### From a file in your workspace

Needs `rive login`.

```bash
rive create --from-remote-file          # pick a project, then a file
rive create demo --from-remote-file=512 # or pass the file id
rive demo
```

The link to the file is recorded in `rive.yaml`, so the project stays linked
to it. `rive push` updates that same file, and `rive pull` brings later editor
changes back down.

### From a `.rev` on disk

No account and no login. The `.rev` might be one you exported from the editor
yourself, or one somebody sent you.

```bash
rive create demo --from-rev=demo_file.rev
```

No link is recorded in `rive.yaml`, because a `.rev` is a file's contents
rather than the file itself. The project starts unlinked, so the first
`rive push` creates a new file in your workspace and links that one. From then
on it behaves like the case above.

Either way, scripts, shaders and assets come out as files laid out the way the
editor's Assets panel had them. See [push.md](push.md).

## When something is wrong

- `rive doctor` — environment, auth, ports, project
- `rive <dir> --verify` — does it compile (Luau type errors included)
- `rive inspect <dir> --summary` — a `problems` list and what got built, by type
- `rive inspect <dir> --json` — the full resolved tree
- [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) — the things that fail silently
